That my mouth might not speak of the works of men, I held to hard ways because of the words of Your lips. Restore my steps in Your paths, that my footsteps may not slip. I cried out, because You listened to me, O God; incline Your ear to me, and hear my words. Magnify Your mercies, O You who save those who hope in You From those who rise up against Your right hand. Keep me as the apple of Your eye; in the shelter of Your wings, You will shelter me From the face of the ungodly who trouble me. My enemies surrounded my soul; their fat enclosed them; their mouth spoke arrogantly. Casting me out, they now surround me; they set their eyes to bend down to the earth. They seized me like a lion ready to tear its prey, like a young lion lurking in secret places. Arise, O Lord, outrun them and trip up their heels; rescue my soul from the ungodly, and Your sword from the enemies of Your hand. O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life. Their belly is filled with Your hidden things; they are satisfied with their sons, and they leave their possessions to their children. As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied when Your glory is revealed. </p></td>

Make known Your ways to me, O Lord, and teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation, and on You I wait all the day. Remember Your compassion, O Lord, and Your mercy, for they are from of old. Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor of my ignorance; but remember me according to Your mercy, because of Your loving-kindness, O Lord. Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He will instruct sinners in His way. He will guide the gentle in judgment; He will teach the gentle His ways. All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth for those who seek His covenant and His testimonies. for Your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my sin, for it is great. Who is the man who fears the Lord? He will instruct him in the way He chooses. His soul shall dwell among good things; His seed shall inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who fear Him, and to those who fear Him, His name is the Lord, and He will show them His covenant. My eyes are always toward the Lord, for He shall pluck my feet out of the trap. Look upon me and have mercy on me, for I am only-begotten and poor. The afflictions of my heart have been widened; bring me out of my distresses. Look on my humiliation and my pain and forgive all my sins. Look on my enemies, because they multiply, and they hate me with unjustified hatred. Keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, because I hope in You.

Against You only have I sinned and done evil in Your sight; that You may be justified in Your words, and overcome when You are judged. for behold, I was conceived in transgressions, and in sins my mother bore me. Behold, You love truth; You showed me the unknown and secret things of Your wisdom. You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed; You shall wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow. You shall make me hear joy and gladness; my bones that were humbled shall greatly rejoice. Turn Your face from my sins, and blot out all my transgressions. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with Your guiding Spirit. I will teach transgressors Your ways, and the ungodly shall turn back to You. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall greatly rejoice in Your righteousness. O Lord, You shall open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. for if You desired sacrifice, I would give it; You will not be pleased with whole burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit, a broken and humbled heart God will not despise. Do good, O Lord, in Your good pleasure to Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be built; then you will be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with offerings and whole burnt offerings; then shall they offer young bulls on Your altar. </p></td>

A thousand shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, yet it shall not come near you; but you shall observe with your eyes, and you shall see the reward of sinners. for You, O Lord, are my hope; You made the Most High your refuge. Evils shall not come to you, and a scourge shall not draw near your dwelling; for He shall command His angels concerning you, to keep you in all your ways; in their hands they shall bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone; You shall tread upon the asp and the basilisk, and you shall trample the lion and the dragon. "For he hoped in Me, and I will deliver him; I will shelter him, because he knew My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will hear him; I am with him in affliction, and I will deliver and glorify him. With length of days I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation." </p></td>

Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, because the Lord has spoken. I begot children and exalted them, but they rejected me. An ox knows its owner, and an ass its lord’s manger; but Israel does not know me, and my people has not understood. Woe, sinful nation, people full of sins, evil seed, lawless children! You have deserted the Lord and angered the Holy One of Israel. Why would you still be smitten as you add iniquity to iniquity? The whole head is in pain and the whole heart in grief; from feet to head there is no wholeness, nothing but wound, bruise, festering sore; it is not possible to apply plaster, or oil, or bandages. Your land is desert, your cities destroyed by fire; as for your country foreigners devour it before your eyes, and it has become a desert, ravaged by foreign peoples. The daughter of Sion will be abandoned, like a tent in a vineyard and like a store house in cucumber patch, like a city besieged. And had the Lord of hosts not left us seed, we had become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrha. Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom. Attend to the law of God, people of Gomorrha. What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord; I am full of holocausts of rams, and the fat of rams and the blood of bulls and goats I do not want. You are not to come to appear to me; who sought these things from your hands? You shall no more come to trample my courts; if you bring flour it is vain; incense is an abomination to me. Your new moons and Sabbaths and high days I do not endure; fast and holiday and your feasts my soul hates; you have become a excess for me, I shall no longer forgive your sins. When you stretch out your hands to me, I shall turn away me eyes from you; and if you multiply supplication, I shall not listen to you; for your hands are full of blood. Wash and become clean; put away the evils from your souls; in my sight cease from your evils, learn to do good, seek out judgement, deliver the wronged, judge for the orphan and do justice to the widow. And come, let us reason together, says the Lord; and if your sins are as scarlet, I will make them white as snow, while if they are crimson, I will make them white as wool. And if you are willing and will listen to me, you eat the good things of the land; but if you are not willing, and will not listen to me, a sword devours you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this. <span class="versiondesignation">(EL)</span>

Because of this many among them will become powerless and will fall and be smashed, and they will draw near and men will be taken in safety. Then they will be manifest who seal themselves not to learn my law. And he will say: I shall wait for God who has turned away his face from the house of Jacob and I shall trust in him. Behold I and the children whom God has given me, and they shall be signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord Sabaoth, who dwells on the mountain of Sion. And if they say to you: Seek out ventriloquists and those who speak from the earth, and those who speak emptiness, those who speak out of their bellies, shall a nation not seek out its God? Why do they seek they dead concerning the living? For he gave the law for a help, that they should speak not according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give concerning it. And harsh famine will come upon you; and it shall be that when you are hungry you shall be grieved and speak ill of the ruler and your ancestral customs, and they will look up to the heaven above, and they will look on the earth below, and behold dire distress and darkness, tribulation and misery and darkness, so that it is impossible to see; and he who in distress will not be distressed only for a moment. [9:1] Do this first, do this quickly, country of Zavoulon, land of Nephthalim, way of the sea and the rest of the inhabitants of the sea coast and beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations, the parts of Judea. The people who walked in darkness, see, a great light! You who dwell in the country and shadow of death a light will shine on you [There is an interesting difference, due to iotacism, between the text here and that in Great Compline, which reads ‘us’ rather than ‘you’. The Book of Hours also has a singular imperative in the previous sentence.]. The most part of the people which you brought down in your joy, they too will be rejoice before you as those who rejoice at harvest and in the way of those who divide the spoil. Because the yoke which lay on them and the rod that was on their neck has been taken away; for the Lord has scattered the rod of those who demanded, as in the day of Madiam. For they shall pay restitution for every robe that has been collected by trickery and every garment with exchange; and they will be willing even if they had been burnt by fire. Because a child has been for us, a son too has been given to us, whose rule was upon his shoulder, and his name is called Angel of great counsel, wondrous counsellor, mighty God, potentate, prince of peace, father of the age to come; for I shall bring peace upon the princes, peace and health to him. Great is his rule and of his peace there is no limit upon the throne of David and his kingdom to establish it and assist it with judgement and with justice from now and for ever; the zeal of the Lord Sabaoth will do all this. <span class="versiondesignation">(EL)</span>

Thus says the Lord: For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David. Then an Angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When morning dawned, they were all dead. Then King Senachereim of Assyria turned and departed, and dwelt in Nineve. As he was worshipping in the house of his tutelary god Nasarach, his sons Adramelech and Sarasar struck him down with swords, and escaped into the land of Armenia. His son Asordan succeeded him. It came to pass at that time that Ezekias became sick and was at the point of death. And the prophet Isaias, son of Amos, came to him, and said to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die. You will not live.’ Then Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying, ‘Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you in truth with a true heart, and have done what is pleasing in your sight’. And Ezekias wept bitterly. Then the word of the Lord came to Isaias: Go and say to Ezekias, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears. See, I am adding fifteen years to your time. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and defend this city’. <span class="versiondesignation">(EL)</span>
