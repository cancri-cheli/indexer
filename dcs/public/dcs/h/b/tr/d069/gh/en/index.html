For You are not a God who wills lawlessness, nor shall the evildoer dwell with You. The lawless shall not stand before Your eyes; You hate all the workers of lawlessness; You shall destroy all who speak falsehood; the Lord abhors the man of violence and deceit. But as for me, in the fullness of Your mercy I will come into Your house; in fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple. Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me. For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open grave; they deal deceptively with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall by their false accusations; cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they provoked You, O Lord. But let all who hope in You be glad; they will greatly rejoice forever, for You will dwell in them; and all who love Your name will boast in You.

The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation. O my God, I will cry out by day, but You will not hear me; and by night, but not for a lack of understanding in me. But You dwell among the saints, O praise of Israel. Our fathers hoped in You; they hoped in You, and You delivered them. They cried out to You and were saved; they hoped in You and were not ashamed. But I am a worm, and not a man; a reproach of man and despised by the people. All who see me mock me; they speak with their lips and shake their head, saying, "He hoped in the Lord, let Him rescue him; let Him save him since He delights in him." For You are He who drew me from the womb, my hope from my mother's breasts; I was cast upon You from the womb, from my mother's womb You are my God. Do not stand off from me, for affliction is near; there is no one to help. Many young bulls surrounded me; fat bulls encircled me. They opened their mouths against me like a raging and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are shattered; my heart is like wax, melting into my stomach. My strength is dried up like an earthen vessel; my tongue cleaves to my throat; and You led me into the dust of death. For many dogs surrounded me; an assembly of evildoers enclosed me; they pierced my hands and my feet. I numbered all my bones, and they look and stare at me. They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots. But You, O Lord, do not remove Your help from me; attend to my aid. Deliver my soul from the sword and my only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion's mouth, my humiliation from the horns of the unicorns. I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the church I will sing to You. You who fear the Lord, praise Him. All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him; fear Him, all you seed of Israel. For He has not despised nor scorned the beggar's supplication, nor has He turned away His face from me; and when I cried out to Him, He heard me. My praise is from You in the great church; I will pay my vows before those who fear Him. The poor shall eat and be well-filled, and those who seek Him will praise the Lord; their hearts will live unto ages of ages. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the Lord; and all families of the Gentiles shall worship before You, for the kingdom is the Lord's; and He is the Master of the Gentiles. All the prosperous of the earth ate and worshiped; all going down into the earth shall bow down before Him, and my soul lives with Him. And my seed shall serve Him; the coming generation shall be told of the Lord, and they will declare His righteousness to a people who will be born, because the Lord made them.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[SAAS<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_saas|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, "I have sinned in betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money." So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me." Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so." But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly. Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?" For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream." Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas." Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified." And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified." So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves." And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!" Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. As they went out, they came upon a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross. And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull), they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus the King of the Jews." Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "This man is calling Elijah." And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him." And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!" There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

Take hold of weapon and shield, and rise up to my help. bring forth the sword, and confine those in opposition who pursue me; say to my soul, "I am your salvation." Let those who seek my soul be dishonored and shamed; let those who plot evils against me be turned backward and disappointed. Let them be like dust in the wind's face, and let the Angel of the Lord afflict them. Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them. For without cause they hid the destruction of their trap for me; in vain they reproached my soul. Let a trap they do not know catch them, and they themselves shall fall into the same trap. But my soul shall greatly rejoice in the Lord; my soul shall delight in His salvation. All my bones shall say, "O Lord, who is like You? You who deliver a poor man from hands stronger than he, and a poor and needy man from those who plunder him." Unjust witnesses rose up against me, asking me things I knew nothing about; they repaid me evil for good, and bereavement for my soul. But I put on sackcloth when they troubled me, and I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer will return into my bosom. Like a neighbor, like our brother, so they were well-pleasing; like one who laments and is of a sad countenance, so I humbled myself. But they were delighted, and were gathered together against me; whips were gathered together against me, but I did not know it; they were torn asunder, yet they were not pierced to the heart. They tempted me; they mocked and sneered at me; they gnashed their teeth at me. O Lord, when will You look on this? Restore my soul from their malice, my only-begotten from the lions. I will give thanks to You, O Lord, in the great church; I will praise You among a mighty people. Let them not rejoice over me, those who are unjustly my enemies, those who hate me without a cause, and wink with their eyes. For they spoke peace to me, but in their wrath they schemed deceit, and opened wide their mouth at me, saying, "Well done! Well done! Our eyes saw it!" You saw this, O Lord; do not keep silence; O Lord, do not be far from me. Arise, O Lord, attend to my judgment, my God and my Lord, to my cause. Judge me according to Your righteousness, O Lord my God, and let them not rejoice against me; let them not say in their hearts, "Well done! Well done, our soul!" Let them not say, "We swallowed him up!" May those who rejoice at my troubles be altogether dishonored and shamed; let those who boast against me be clothed with shame and humiliation. Let those who desire my righteousness greatly rejoice, and be glad, and let them say continually, "The Lord be magnified," Those who desire His servant's peace.

Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me, but I continued to pray; so they repaid me evil for good, and hatred for my love. Set a sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand. And when he is judged, may he go forth condemned, and let his prayer become sin. Let his days be very few, and may a different man receive his office; let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children wander about and be beggars; let them be cast out of their houses. Let the creditor search out whatever possessions he has; let strangers plunder his labors; let there be no helper for him, nor a compassionate one for his fatherless children; let his children be utterly destroyed; in a single generation, let his name be blotted out. May the lawlessness of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and may the sin of his mother not be blotted out; let them be continually before the Lord, and may the remembrance of them be utterly destroyed from the earth, because he did not remember to show mercy, but persecuted a poor and needy man, and one pierced to the heart, that he might kill him. And he loved cursing, and it came to him, and he did not desire blessing, so it shall be far from him. So he clothed himself with cursing like a garment, and it entered like water into his bowels and like oil into his bones; let it be for him like a garment that clothes him, and like a belt that girds him continually. This is the work of those who falsely accuse me before the Lord, and of those who speak evil things against my soul. But You, O Lord, O Lord, deal mercifully with me for Your name's sake, for Your mercy is good. Save me, for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me. I was removed like a shadow when it declines; I was shaken off like the locusts. My knees were weak from fasting, and my flesh was changed because of the oil. And I became an object of reproach to them; they saw me; they shook their heads. Help me, O Lord my God; save me according to Your mercy; then let them know this is Your hand, and You, O Lord, did this. They themselves shall curse, but You shall bless; let those who rise up against me be put to shame, but let Your servant be glad. Let those who falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them be covered with their dishonor like a double cloak.

And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him. And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull). And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it. And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews." And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!" So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah." And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down." And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!" There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

Just as many shall be astonished at You, so Your form and glory shall be dishonored by men. Thus many nations shall marvel at Him, and kings shall shut their mouth, because they to whom no report was brought concerning Him shall see; and they who did not hear shall understand. O Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed? We proclaimed His presence as a Child, as a Root in the thirsty land. He had no form or glory, and we saw Him; and He had no form or beauty. But in comparison to all men, His form was lacking in honor. He was a man in suffering and knew how to bear sickness. His face was turned away, and He was dishonored and not esteemed. He bears our sins and suffers for us, yet we considered Him to be in pain, suffering, and ill-treatment. But He was wounded because of our lawlessness, and became sick because of our sins. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His bruise we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray. Man has gone astray in his way, and the Lord delivered Him over for our sins. Although He was ill-treated, He opened not His mouth. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb is silent before his shearers, so He opens not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth, and because of the lawlessness of My people He was led to death. I will appoint evil men for His burial and rich men for His death, because He committed no lawlessness, nor was deceit found in His mouth. The Lord wishes to cleanse Him of His wound, and if You give an offering for sin, Your soul shall see a long-lived seed. The Lord wishes to take away the pain of His soul, to show Him light, to form Him with understanding, and to pronounce righteous the Righteous One who serves many well; and He shall bear their sins. Therefore He shall inherit many, and will divide the spoil with the strong, because His soul was delivered over to death. He was considered among the lawless, and He bore the sins of many, and was delivered over because of their sins. "Be glad, O barren woman who does not bear; break forth and cry out, you who are not in travail, for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married woman."</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[SAAS<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_saas|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

And again, "Here am I, and the children God has given me." Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage. For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." And they cast lots to divide his garments. And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!" The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar, and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!" There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews." One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!" But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong." And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!" And having said this he breathed his last. Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, "Certainly this man was innocent!" And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

O Lord, O Lord of hosts, let not those who wait for You be put to shame because of me; O God of Israel, let not those who seek You feel ashamed because of me. For Your sake I bore disgrace; humiliation covered my face. I am become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's sons; for the zeal of Your house consumed me, and the insults of those who disgraced You fell on me. I bent down my soul with fasting, and it became a disgrace for me. I also made sackcloth my garment, and I became a byword to them. Those who sit at the gate were talking against me, and those who drink wine were singing about me. But I, O Lord, pray with my prayer to You; it is the time of Your goodwill, O God, in the abundance of Your mercies; in the truth of Your salvation, hear me. Save me from the mire, that I may not be stuck therein; deliver me from those who hate me, and from the depths of the waters. Let not a storm of water drown me; neither let the deep swallow me up, nor the well enclose its mouth upon me. Hear me, O Lord, for Your mercy is good; according to Your abundant compassion, look upon me. Turn not Your face from Your child, for I am afflicted; hear me speedily. Give heed to my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies. For You know my disgrace and my shame and humiliation; all who afflict me are before You. My soul expected disgrace and trouble, and I waited for someone to sympathize with me; but no one was there, and for comforters, but I found not one. They gave me gall for my food, and they gave me vinegar for my drink. Let their table become a snare before them, and a recompense and a stumbling block. Let their eyes be darkened so they may not see, and bend down their backs continually; pour out Your anger upon them, and let the fury of Your wrath lay hold of them. Let their dwelling place be laid waste, and let no one live in their tents. For they pursued closely the one You slew, and they added to the pain of my wounds. Add lawlessness to their lawlessness, and let them not enter into Your righteousness; let them be blotted out from the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. I am poor and suffering, and the salvation of Your presence, O God, lays hold of me. I will praise God's name with a song; I will magnify Him in praise, and this shall be more pleasing to God than a young bull with horns and hooves. Let the poor behold this, and be glad; seek God, and your soul shall live, for the Lord hears the poor, and does not despise His prisoners. Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them. For God shall save Zion, and the cities of Judah shall be built; and they shall dwell therein, and inherit it; and the seed of His servants shall possess it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[SAAS<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_saas|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

They plotted an evil device against me, saying, "Come, let us put wood in his bread, and destroy him root and branch from the land of the living, so his name might not be remembered any longer." But, O Lord, You who judge righteously, who tests minds and hearts, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have revealed my righteous plea to You. Therefore thus says the Lord against the men of Anathoth, against those who seek my life, and who say, "Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord, lest you die by our hands"— "Behold, I will visit them. The young men shall die by the sword, and their sons and daughters shall die by famine. There shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring calamities on the inhabitants of Anathoth in the year of their visitation." O Lord, You are righteous, that I may plead my case with You, to speak to You concerning judgments. Why does the way of the ungodly prosper, and all who deal treacherously flourish? You planted them, and they took root. They bear children and are fruitful. You are near in their mouth, but far from their mind. But You, O Lord, know me. You have proven my heart before You. Set them apart for the day of slaughter. How long will the land mourn and the grass of the field wither, because of the vices of those who dwell in it? The cattle and the birds are destroyed, because they said, "God will not see our ways." "Your feet run and grow weary. Gather together all the wild beasts of the field and let them come to devour her. Many shepherds destroyed My vineyard and defiled My portion. They turned My pleasant portion into an impassable desert. It was made a complete ruin." For thus says the Lord: "Concerning all the evil neighbors who touch My inheritance, which I divided to My people Israel—behold, I shall draw them away from their land and will cast out Judah from their midst. Then it shall come to pass, after I cast them out, that I will return them and have mercy on them. I will settle them, each in his inheritance and each in his land."</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[SAAS<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_saas|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful; and let us consider how to stir up one another to love good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near. For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries. A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." And again, "The Lord will judge his people." It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be." This was to fulfil the scripture, "They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots." So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son!" Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), "I thirst." A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished"; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth—that you also may believe. For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of him shall be broken." And again another scripture says, "They shall look on him whom they have pierced."</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

My soul shall be praised in the Lord; let the gentle hear, and be glad. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together. I sought the Lord, and He heard me; and He delivered me from all my sojourning. Come to Him, and be enlightened, and your face shall never be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his afflictions. The Angel of the Lord shall encamp around those who fear Him, and He will deliver them. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who hopes in Him. Fear the Lord, you His saints, for there is no want for those who fear Him. Rich men turned poor and went hungry; but those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing. Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is the man who desires life, who loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Shun evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open to their supplications. The Lord's face is against those who do evil, so as to destroy their remembrance from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them; and He delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is near those who are brokenhearted, and He will save the humble in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but He will deliver them from them all. The Lord shall guard all their bones; not one of them shall be broken. The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the righteous shall go wrong. The Lord will redeem the souls of His servants, and all who hope in Him shall not go wrong.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[GOA<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_goa|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>, SAAS<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_saas|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>
