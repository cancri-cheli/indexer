For You are not a God who wills lawlessness, nor shall the evildoer dwell with You. The lawless shall not stand before Your eyes; You hate all the workers of lawlessness; You shall destroy all who speak falsehood; the Lord abhors the man of violence and deceit. But as for me, in the fullness of Your mercy I will come into Your house; in fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple. Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me. For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open grave; they deal deceptively with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall by their false accusations; cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they provoked You, O Lord. But let all who hope in You be glad; they will greatly rejoice forever, for You will dwell in them; and all who love Your name will boast in You.

One thing I ask from the Lord; this I will seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, and behold the delights of the Lord, and visit His temple. For He hid me in His tabernacle in the day of my troubles; He sheltered me in the secret place of His tabernacle; He set me high upon a rock. And now, behold, He has lifted up my head above my enemies; I went around and offered in His tabernacle a sacrifice of joy; I will sing to the Lord, and praise Him with the harp. O Lord, hear my voice, wherein I cry; have mercy on me and hear me. My heart speaks to You; my face seeks You; Your face, O Lord, I will seek. Do not turn away Your face from me; do not turn away from Your servant in wrath; be my helper; do not utterly cast me away, nor forsake me, O God my savior. For my father and my mother forsook me, but the Lord laid hold of me. Instruct me, O Lord, in the way of Your law; set me on a straight path because of my enemies. Do not deliver me to the souls of those who afflict me, for unjust witnesses rise up against me; and injustice lies to itself. I believe I shall see the Lord's goodness in the land of the living.

No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous animals go up on it, nor at all be found there.

I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie." Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him. Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead; and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism." And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus." On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

Lift up Your hands against their arrogance to the end, against everything the enemy prostituted in Your holy places. Those who hate You boasted in the midst of Your feast; they set up their signs, yes signs, and they did not know. As into an entrance hall, as in a thicket of trees, they cut down its doors with axes; with battle axes and hammers, they broke it down. They burned down Your sanctuary; they defiled the tabernacle of Your name to the ground. Their kindred said in their heart together, "Come, let us abolish all the feasts of God from the earth." We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and He will no longer know us. How long, O God, will the enemy reproach? Will the adversary provoke Your name to the end? Why do You turn away Your hand, Your right hand from the midst of Your breast to the end? But God is our King before the ages; He worked salvation in the midst of the earth. You strengthened the sea by Your power; You crushed the heads of dragons upon the water. You shattered the heads of the dragon; You gave him as food for the Ethiopian peoples. You broke apart fountains and torrents; You dried up the rivers of Etham. The day is Yours, and the night is Yours; You created the light and the sun. You made all the boundaries of the earth; summer and winter, You formed these things. Remember this: the enemy insulted the Lord, and a foolish people provoked Your name. May You not deliver to wild beasts the soul who gives thanks to You; may You not forget the souls of Your poor to the end. Look upon Your covenant, for the dark places of the earth are filled with the houses of lawlessness. Let not the humbled and the disgraced be turned away; the poor and needy shall praise Your name. Arise, O God, judge Your cause; remember the insults against You by the foolish man all the day long.

What is it to you, O sea, that you fled, and to you, O Jordan, that you turned back? What is it to you, O mountains, that you skipped like rams, and you, O hills, like flocks of lambs?

Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory, for Your mercy and Your truth, lest the nations say, "Where is their God?" Our God is in heaven above; and both in heaven and on earth, all things whatsoever He wills, He does. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands; they have a mouth, but they shall not speak; they have eyes, but they shall not see; they have ears, but they shall not hear; they have noses, but they shall not smell; they have hands, but they shall not feel; they have feet, but they shall not walk; they shall make no sound with their throats. May those who make them become like them, and all who trust in them. The house of Israel hoped in the Lord; He is their help and their protector. The house of Aaron hoped in the Lord; He is their help and their protector. Those who feared the Lord hoped in the Lord; He is their help and their protector. The Lord remembered us and blessed us; He blessed the house of Israel; He blessed the house of Aaron; He blessed those who feared the Lord, the least with the greatest. May the Lord increase you, both you and your children; you are blessed by the Lord, who made heaven and earth. The heaven of heaven belongs to the Lord, but He gave the earth to the sons of men.

I give You as a covenant to the Gentiles, to establish the earth and to inherit the inheritance of the desert; saying to those in bonds, ‘Go forth,’ and to those in darkness, ‘Reveal yourselves.’ They shall feed along all their roads, and their pasture shall be along all the paths. They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst, nor shall the burning heat of the sun strike them; but He who has mercy on them will comfort them; and He shall lead them by the fountains of waters. I will make every mountains as a road, and every path as a pasture for them. Behold, these come from afar, these from the north and these from the sea, and the others from the land of the Persians.” Be glad, O heavens, and rejoice exceedingly, O earth. Let the mountains break out in gladness, and the hills in righteousness. For the Lord had mercy on His people, and comforted the humble of His people. But Zion said, “The Lord forsook me, and the Lord forgot me.” “Will a woman forget her child, so as not to have mercy on the offspring of her womb? But even if a woman should forget these things, nevertheless, I shall not forget you,” says the Lord.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[SAAS<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_saas|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>

As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God." He said therefore to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits that befit repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." And the multitudes asked him, "What then shall we do?" And he answered them, "He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise." Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Collect no more than is appointed you." Soldiers also asked him, "And we, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Rob no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your wages." As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ, John answered them all, "I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." So, with many other exhortations, he preached good news to the people.</span> <span class="versiondesignation">[RSV<span class='key' data-key='properties_en_US_rsv|version.designation' hidden='hidden'></span>]</span>
